I am a fourth-year PhD student advised by [Prof. Elias Bareinboim](https://causalai.net/) in the [Computer Science department at Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/). My research interests are casual inference and machine learning. Recently, I have been working on causal generative models and causal representation learning. My personal goal is to make ML algorithms trustworthy and reliable with causality.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my master's study at Caltech and I was fortunate enough to work with [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/) on data-driven optimization. In my undergrad, I worked with [Prof. Yuantao Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FL61g6wAAAAJ&hl=en) on compressive sensing and hyperspectral image clustering at Tsinghua University.

<!--In my undergrad, I studied Electrical Engineering at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), double-majoring in Economics at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).-->
